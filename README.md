# Deprecation Philosophy Moving Forward
With the introduction of the #[\Deprecated] attribute in PHP 8.3, we are formalizing our approach to deprecation.
Going forward, all deprecated features will be explicitly marked using this attribute to ensure clarity,
better tooling support, and smoother migration paths for developers.

# Installation
Typical composer installation is supported, simply run the following command:

```
composer require stoic/stoic
```

Alternatively, downloads are available via the releases page here on GitHub.
