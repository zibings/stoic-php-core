## Dispatches
Dispatches in the Stoic chain system are data.  Any information
that should be carried along a chain should be stored within the
dispatch.  This makes the data available to any node which
receives the dispatch during chain traversal, and allows it to
serve as a container for results returned by any nodes that
record them.
